Our research started with a notion to create and foster ‘Skill Enhancement - Tech Accelerator’ programs for the neurodivergent and LGBTQ+ communities. This notion is backed up with organizational success experience along with 20+ years of working with top IT-teams. 

### We want to :

Create a few robust programs that work in tandem with the mechanism of training and job placement for the passionate participants from the mentioned communities.

# What’s on our mind ?

### Can it be done ?

Yes of course!  

As per the “[Great Place To Work](https://www.greatplacetowork.com/resources/blog/how-to-build-and-support-neurodiversity-in-the-workplace)” e-magazine, a safe space is necessary for both neurotypical employees to ask questions and for neurodivergent employees to come forward and disclose. While we know that in computer programming jobs, pure logic dictates everything and there is always a simple and clear reason for things that are working or otherwise. 

[Drexel University’s National Autism Indicators Report](https://www.ey.com/en_us/diversity-inclusiveness/how-neurodiversity-is-driving-innovation-from-unexpected-places) says **51% of workers on the spectrum have skills higher than what their job requires**. What would it take to harness this pool of higher skills, and invest them in developing this era of digitalization of almost everything around us? 

# How can logic influence cognition ?

**Cognition** refers to "mental processes of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thoughts, and experiences, while, logic ****is an interdisciplinary-academic approach towards truth and reasoning”. 

What do you think in a blink-? , Doesn’t it sound like they were made for each other ?

To me they do!, And it also looks like there is a clear path of success laid from the development of logical thought processes towards developing one’s cognitive skills. Cognitive skills are the processes that a brain remembers, reasons, holds attention, solves problems, thinks, reads and learns. By **developing** cognitive skills, One can boost one’s brain to complete these processes more quickly and efficiently, one can also ensure that they understand and effectively process that new information. 

Let’s take “Piaget’s ideas” as a reference in this conversation, By filtering out influence from neurotypical adults, young and unexplored brains have shown traits and capabilities of understanding concepts in communication and hence develop logic. So, considering a scenario where a young/un-exposed brain is subjected to develop a new cognitive skill, teaching/training/mentoring them with content filled with logic can be a good booster pack.
